# Add support for reading an external config file. This enables using the following options for
# configuring the module:
# - environment variables
# - YAML config file located at the absolute path "/config/config.yaml"

# Default config settings for your module. These settings will be applied unless you override them with a 
# configuration file and/or environment variable. We recommend using a configuration file (i.e. ConfigMap) to set all
# parameters with the exception of secrets which should be linked into the pod as env variables via K8 Secrets.
